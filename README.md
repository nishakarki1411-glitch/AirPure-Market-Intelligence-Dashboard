# AirPure-Market-Intelligence-Dashboard

✦ Project Overview

Air pollution is one of the most serious challenges facing India today, with many cities consistently ranking among the most polluted in the world. This project focuses on analyzing AQI data across states and cities to uncover patterns, health impacts, pollutant breakdowns, and regional differences.

The dashboard is designed to help AirPure Innovations, a startup exploring the Indian air purifier market, understand where the demand is likely to be highest and which factors drive consumer behavior.

All analysis and insights were developed using SQL for data extraction and cleaning and Power BI for modeling, visualization, and storytelling.

◆ Problem Statement

AirPure Innovations is considering entering the Indian air purifier market. To make informed decisions, the company needs answers to key questions:
➤ What are the major pollutants and which regions are most affected?
➤ How does AQI vary by city, state, and time (weekdays vs weekends, seasonal patterns)?
➤ Which health issues correlate most with rising AQI levels?
➤ Where will future demand for purifiers be the strongest?
➤ How do EV adoption and government incentives influence AQI levels?

▣ Primary Analysis Questions

Identify the top 5 and bottom 5 areas with the highest average AQI in the last 6 months.

Find the top 2 and bottom 2 pollutants in each southern Indian state (2022 onwards).

Compare AQI levels on weekends vs weekdays in metro cities.

Highlight the months with the worst air quality across states.

Analyze Bengaluru’s AQI categories (Mar–May 2025).

Link most reported illnesses by state in the last 3 years with AQI levels.

Compare AQI in top 5 EV adoption states vs low-adoption states.

▣ Secondary Analysis Questions

Which age groups are most impacted by pollution-related illnesses?

Who are the major players in India’s air purifier market and what features do they offer?

How does population size of a city relate to its AQI in 2024?

What is the level of awareness among citizens about AQI and its impact?

Which government policies in the past 5 years show measurable improvements in AQI?

✦ Tools & Skills Used

SQL → for extracting, cleaning, and preparing AQI and related data

Power BI → for modeling, DAX measures, building interactive dashboards, and storytelling

▣ Dashboard Highlights

AQI Trends – State and city-level analysis over time

Pollutant Breakdown – Top pollutants across regions

Health Impact – AQI linked with reported illnesses

Seasonality – Months and seasons with worst AQI

EV Adoption vs AQI – Does cleaner mobility reduce pollution?

Projections – Future AQI risks and purifier demand hotspots

✦ Key Insights

1.Weekday pollution spikes in metro cities show strong links with traffic and lifestyle patterns.

2.Southern states have a different pollutant mix compared to northern metros, suggesting purifier features should be localized.

3.States with high EV adoption are beginning to see improved AQI, but changes remain uneven.

4.Respiratory illnesses like asthma are strongly correlated with AQI spikes.

5.Forecasts point to several Tier-2 cities becoming high-risk zones, opening future purifier market opportunities.
